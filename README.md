## Overview

Ethos-Protocol mobile apps (iOS + Android) provide a native interface for managing vaults, checking in, and receiving expiry reminders. Both apps share the same REST API contract and feature set.

```

## Key Design Decisions

### Passkey Authentication (WebAuthn)
- **iOS**: `ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider` (iOS 16+)
- **Android**: `CredentialManager` API (Android 9+, API 28+)
- Flow: `getChallenge()` → device biometric prompt → `verifyPasskey()` → JWT stored in Keychain/SharedPreferences
- Relying party: `ethos-protocol.app` (requires `.well-known/assetlinks.json` + Apple App Site Association)

### Push Notifications
- **iOS**: APNs via `UNUserNotificationCenter`. Device token registered to backend on first launch.
  - Local reminders scheduled 24h before vault expiry via `UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger`
  - Actionable notification category `CHECK_IN` with inline "Check In" action
- **Android**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Token refreshed via `onNewToken`.
  - Notification channel `ttl_reminders` (IMPORTANCE_HIGH)
  - Deep-link intent to `MainActivity` with `vault_id` extra

### Offline Support
- `NetworkMonitor` checks live connectivity before every request
- `OfflineCache` stores last successful GET responses keyed by URL (SHA-256 filename)
- On network unavailable: cached data served transparently; mutations show "offline" error
- iOS: `CryptoKit.SHA256` for cache keys; Android: `MessageDigest("SHA-256")`
- **Offline check-in queue**: a check-in made while offline is queued for retry rather
  than just failing.
  - iOS: `PendingCheckInStore` (disk-backed JSON) is the sole insertion point; `CheckInSyncTask`
    drains it via a `BGProcessingTask` once connectivity returns. This is the only check-in
    queue implementation — an earlier duplicate (`CheckInQueue`/`CheckInSyncService`) was
    removed in 8d8d59d; see `PendingCheckInStoreTests`/`CheckInSyncTaskTests` for the
    regression guard.
  - Android: `PendingActionDao`/`PendingActionDatabase` (Room), drained by `PendingActionSyncWorker` (WorkManager)

### State Management
- **iOS**: `@StateObject` / `ObservableObject` stores (`AuthStore`, `VaultStore`) injected via SwiftUI environment
- **Android**: Hilt-injected `ViewModel`s with `StateFlow` + `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`

## Setup

### iOS
1. Install [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`) — the `.xcodeproj` is generated, not checked in
2. From `ios/EthosProtocol`, run `mkdir -p Xcode && xcodegen generate --project Xcode` to produce `Xcode/EthosProtocol.xcodeproj` (an `EthosProtocol` app target + `TTLWidget` widget extension, per `project.yml`) — the `Xcode/` directory must exist before `xcodegen generate` runs, or the copy step fails
3. Open `ios/EthosProtocol/Xcode/EthosProtocol.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+
4. Set your Apple Developer Team in signing settings for both the `EthosProtocol` and `TTLWidget` targets (`project.yml` leaves `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` blank on purpose — bundle IDs `com.ethosprotocol` / `com.ethosprotocol.TTLWidget` are already set)
5. `API_BASE_URL` is already set in `EthosProtocol/Info.plist` and `TTLWidget/Info.plist`; edit both (they're separate bundles, read independently at runtime) if you need to point at a different environment
6. Certificate pinning is **not active by default**: both `Info.plist`s declare `TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PINS` as the `$(TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_CURRENT)` / `$(TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_BACKUP)` build settings (declared blank in `project.yml`), and `PinningDelegate` ignores blank/unexpanded entries. Set both settings to Base64-encoded SPKI SHA-256 hashes — in Xcode's build settings, an `.xcconfig`, or on the `xcodebuild` invocation (`xcodebuild … TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_CURRENT=… TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_BACKUP=…`) — before shipping a Release build; see `Sources/Services/CertificatePinning.swift` for the rotation strategy. `ios-ci.yml`'s `build-and-test` job runs `.github/scripts/check_tls_pinning.py --configuration Release` against both files and fails the build if either is missing or empty; Debug builds are exempt (`PinningDelegate` intentionally treats an empty pin set as "pinning disabled" for local dev)
7. Configure Apple App Site Association at `https://ethos-protocol.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`, listing this app's App ID under both `applinks` (Universal Links) and `webcredentials` (platform passkeys). CI automatically verifies this file daily and on any change to `EthosProtocol.entitlements` (see `ios-applinks-verify.yml`).
8. In the Apple Developer portal, enable Push Notifications, Associated Domains, iCloud (Key-Value storage), and Keychain Sharing capabilities for the `com.ethosprotocol` App ID, and Keychain Sharing for `com.ethosprotocol.TTLWidget` — matching `EthosProtocol/EthosProtocol.entitlements` / `TTLWidget/TTLWidget.entitlements`. Set up an APNs key in App Store Connect for push.
9. Re-run `mkdir -p Xcode && xcodegen generate --project Xcode` any time `project.yml` changes; the generated `Xcode/` directory is disposable and shouldn't be committed

### Android
1. Open `android` in Android Studio Hedgehog+
2. Add `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
3. Configure `assetlinks.json` at `https://ethos-protocol.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. CI automatically verifies this file daily and on any change to `AndroidManifest.xml` (see `android-applinks-verify.yml`).
4. Set `API_BASE_URL` in `build.gradle.kts` `buildConfigField`
5. Configure the certificate pins for release builds by setting `ETHOS_CERT_PINS` (environment variable) or `ethos.certPins` (in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, never committed) to a comma-separated list of Base64 SHA-256 SPKI digests — the current certificate's pin plus a backup for the next one. This is required before any release build: pinning is **not** active by default. When unset, `CertificatePinner`'s pin set is empty — pinning is disabled and the system trust store decides (#169), so there is no compiled-in pin that could reject every real certificate. CI's `Verify release certificate pins are not placeholders` step reports an unconfigured release build (#173), and fails it outright once the pins are configured but wrong, or once release signing is configured (i.e. the artifact is actually shippable). Debug builds are not gated, since an empty pin set disables pinning for local/dev hosts. Compute a pin with:
   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect api.ethos-protocol.app:443 2>/dev/null \
     | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der \
     | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
   ```

## Testing

### iOS
```bash
cd ios/EthosProtocol
swift test
```
Covers: model decoding, Keychain round-trip, offline cache, Base64URL encoding.
Tests run against the SPM package (`Package.swift`) directly and don't require the
XcodeGen-generated project; CI runs this the same way, via `xcodebuild test` against
an iOS Simulator destination (`swift test` alone defaults to macOS, which can't build
the app's iOS-only framework imports).

#### iOS SPM Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
CI runs a weekly (and per-PR on `Package.swift` / `Package.resolved` changes) vulnerability
scan against all pinned SPM dependencies using [osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner),
querying the [OSV database](https://osv.dev). The scan fails the build for any dependency
with a published CVE at CVSS ≥ 7.0 (high or critical). This mirrors the Android
`android-dependency-check.yml` OWASP scan.

Workflow: `.github/workflows/ios-dependency-check.yml`

False-positive suppressions: `ios/EthosProtocol/spm-vulnerability-suppressions.toml`
(follows the same pattern as `android/dependency-check-suppressions.xml` — each entry
requires a documented rationale).

To run locally:
```bash
brew install osv-scanner
cd ios/EthosProtocol
osv-scanner --lockfile "swift:Package.resolved" --fail-on-severity HIGH
```

### Android
```bash
cd android
./gradlew test                  # Unit tests (JVM)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # Instrumented tests (device/emulator)
```
Covers: ViewModel state transitions, model logic, Compose UI smoke tests.

#### RTL Layout Testing (Issue #314)

The app supports Right-to-Left (RTL) locales (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) via automatic layout mirroring. To test RTL functionality:

**Enable RTL layout direction on a device/emulator:**
```bash
adb shell settings put global debug.force_rtl_layout 1
```

**Run the app and verify:**
- All screens display with proper mirroring (buttons, text, icons)
- No text clipping or overlap at edges
- Numerical values format correctly (see Issue #313 for locale-aware formatting)

**Disable RTL when done:**
```bash
adb shell settings put global debug.force_rtl_layout 0
```

See [docs/rtl-layout-testing.md](docs/rtl-layout-testing.md) for comprehensive RTL testing procedures on both platforms.

### iOS RTL Testing

Enable RTL pseudo-language in Xcode to test Right-to-Left layout support:

1. Edit Scheme → Run → Options
2. Set "App Language" to an RTL pseudo-language (e.g., `ar-XB` for Arabic-Pseudo)
3. Run the app and verify all screens mirror correctly

## App Performance Monitoring (APM)

### Overview

Both platforms automatically capture screen load times and API response times with no user action required. **iOS** uses an `os_signpost`-based `PerformanceMonitor` (zero external dependencies — traces appear natively in Instruments). **Android** uses Firebase Performance Monitoring with manual traces, surfaced in the Firebase Console.

### iOS APM

- **`PerformanceMonitor.shared`** — singleton; records API metrics and screen metrics in-memory with a rolling retention buffer (100 API entries, 50 screen entries).
- **`ScreenTracingModifier` / `.trackScreen("Name")`** — SwiftUI `ViewModifier` applied to top-level screens. Measures the time between `.onAppear` and `.onDisappear` and records it via `recordScreenLoad`.
- **`APMConfiguration`** — central threshold constants: `apiSlowThresholdMs: 2000`, `screenSlowThresholdMs: 500`, etc.
- No additional setup required; `os_signpost` intervals are automatically visible in **Instruments > System Trace**.
- To view traces: **Product > Profile (Cmd+I) > System Trace**, then filter by subsystem `com.ethosprotocol`.
- `PerformanceMonitor.shared.summary()` returns a `PerformanceSummary` with p50/p95/p99 for API calls, slow-call counts, and average screen load time.

### Android APM

- **Firebase Performance Monitoring** (`firebase-perf-ktx`) added under the existing Firebase BOM — no separate version pin needed.
- **`PerformanceMonitor`** object in `utils/` — wraps Firebase traces and maintains bounded in-memory ring buffers for local aggregation.
- **`TrackScreen("Name")`** composable — `DisposableEffect`-based helper; add it as the first call inside any screen composable to measure its active lifetime.
- **`APMConfiguration`** — same threshold constants as iOS (`API_SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS`, `SCREEN_SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS`, etc.).
- Firebase setup: ensure `google-services.json` is present (already required for FCM — see Android setup step 2).
- View traces in **Firebase Console > Performance > Traces** tab.

### Performance Alert Thresholds

Thresholds follow the Google RAIL model: response < 100 ms feels instant, < 1 000 ms is noticeable, > 5 000 ms causes abandonment.

| Metric | Slow (warn) | Critical (alert) |
|---|---|---|
| API response | > 2 000 ms | > 5 000 ms |
| Screen load | > 500 ms | > 2 000 ms |
| App startup | > 3 000 ms | — |

Slow calls are logged at error level on both platforms. Counts appear in `PerformanceMonitor.shared.summary()` (iOS) and `PerformanceMonitor.summary()` (Android).

### Local Development

- **iOS**: `PerformanceMonitor.shared.reset()` clears in-memory metrics between test runs.
- **Android**: `PerformanceMonitor.reset()` clears in-memory metrics between test runs.
- **Both**: slow-call log entries appear in the system log / logcat under the `PerformanceMonitor` tag.

## CI/CD Workflow

All CI/CD is driven by GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows/`. Workflows are triggered on `push` to `main`, on `pull_request` targeting `main`, and on a weekly `schedule` for security and drift checks.

### Continuous Integration

- **iOS** (`ios-ci.yml`): generates the Xcode project via XcodeGen, runs `xcodebuild test` against an iOS Simulator destination, and runs `.github/scripts/check_tls_pinning.py --configuration Release` to fail the build if TLS pins are missing or empty.
- **Android** (`android-ci.yml`): runs `./gradlew test` (JVM unit tests) and `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` (instrumented tests) on an emulator, plus `verifyPaparazziDebug` for snapshot comparison.
- **Dependency scanning**: `android-dependency-check.yml` (OWASP) and `ios-dependency-check.yml` (osv-scanner) run weekly and on dependency manifest changes, failing on high/critical CVEs.
- **App Links verification**: `ios-applinks-verify.yml` and `android-applinks-verify.yml` verify the hosted `apple-app-site-association` and `assetlinks.json` files daily and on entitlement/manifest changes.
- **Parity validation**: `release-notes-parity-check.yml` ensures release notes stay aligned with the "Known gaps" table in `PARITY.md`.
- **Staging smoke test**: `staging-smoke-test.yml` exercises auth, `GET /vaults`, and `POST /vaults/{id}/checkin` against a staging deployment via `scripts/smoke_test_staging.sh`.

### Build Artifacts

- **iOS**: the XcodeGen-generated `Xcode/EthosProtocol.xcodeproj` is disposable and not committed; the shippable artifact is the signed `.ipa` produced from a Release build with `TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_CURRENT` / `TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_BACKUP` set.
- **Android**: the shippable artifact is the signed `.apk` / `.aab` produced from a Release build with `ETHOS_CERT_PINS` configured (via `ETHOS_CERT_PINS` env var or `ethos.certPins` in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`).
- **Coverage reports**: uploaded to Codecov under the `ios` and `android` flags (see badges above).
- **Test reports**: JUnit XML and Paparazzi snapshot diffs are uploaded as workflow artifacts for inspection on failure.

### Release Process

1. Ensure all CI checks on `main` are green, including dependency scans and App Links verification.
2. Confirm `PARITY.md`'s "Known gaps" table matches the release notes (enforced by `release-notes-parity-check.yml`).
3. Verify TLS pins are configured for iOS (`TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_CURRENT` / `TLS_PUBLIC_KEY_PIN_BACKUP`) and Android (`ETHOS_CERT_PINS`) — release builds fail if pins are placeholders or wrong.
4. Run the staging smoke test against the target staging deployment.
5. Tag the release and build signed artifacts for both platforms.
6. Publish release notes and update the parity tracking table if any gaps were closed.

### Deployment Procedures

- **Staging**: deploy the backend to the staging environment referenced by `STAGING_API_BASE_URL`, then run `staging-smoke-test.yml` (or `scripts/smoke_test_staging.sh` locally) to validate the client/backend contract before cutting a release.
- **Production (iOS)**: distribute the signed `.ipa` via App Store Connect; ensure APNs key, Associated Domains, and Keychain Sharing capabilities are enabled for `com.ethosprotocol` and `com.ethosprotocol.TTLWidget`.
- **Production (Android)**: distribute the signed `.aab` via Google Play Console; ensure `google-services.json` is present and `assetlinks.json` is hosted at `https://ethos-protocol.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.
- **Rollback**: revert to the previous tagged release artifact; both platforms support staged rollout so a bad build can be halted before full rollout.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Dependency vulnerability scanning
The repo runs a dependency scan for both platforms with the same trigger model:
- `push` to `main` when dependency manifests change
- `pull_request` to `main` for the same dependency-focused paths
- weekly `schedule` runs to catch newly disclosed CVEs between dependency bumps

Workflow files:
- Android: `.github/workflows/android-dependency-check.yml`
- iOS: `.github/workflows/ios-dependency-check.yml`

Both workflows treat dependency-scan failures as a consistent, human-readable warning in the job log and create a scheduled-run issue alert when the scan fails outside a PR context.

### Release notes parity-gap validation
Release notes are expected to stay aligned with the "Known gaps" table in [PARITY.md](PARITY.md). To prevent a release from claiming a parity issue is closed while the table still lists it as open, CI includes a parity audit workflow:

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release-notes-parity-check.yml`
- Script: `.github/scripts/release_notes_parity_check.py`

The validator:
- extracts issue numbers from the "Known gaps" table in [PARITY.md](PARITY.md)
- scans merged PRs for parity-gap issue references and close verbs such as "closes #..." or "fixes #..."
- checks the current release notes for the same claim patterns
- fails when a listed parity gap is explicitly called out as closed without the table being updated

Run it locally from the repo root with:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/release_notes_parity_check.py \
  --parity-file PARITY.md \
  --prs-file merged-prs.json \
  --release-notes-file release-notes.md
```

To generate the JSON input for the PR scan:

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --limit 200 --json number,title,body > merged-prs.json
```

This keeps parity-status messaging consistent with the cross-platform tracking table and helps release notes communicate platform catch-up progress accurately.

### iOS App Store release automation
Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag (matching `MARKETING_VERSION` in `ios/EthosProtocol/project.yml`) builds, signs, and uploads the iOS app to TestFlight via fastlane. Review submission is opt-in and gated behind approval on the `app-store` environment. Manual runs default to a credential-free dry run.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/ios-app-store-release.yml`
- Lanes: `ios/EthosProtocol/fastlane/Fastfile` (`validate`, `beta`, `app_store`)
- "What's New" generator: `.github/scripts/generate_release_notes.py`
- Setup, secrets, and the maintainer checklist: [docs/ios-app-store-release.md](docs/ios-app-store-release.md)

### iOS TestFlight external beta distribution (#461)
Every push to `main` builds a signed Release IPA and distributes it to external TestFlight
tester groups automatically. Build notes are generated from conventional commits since the
last tag. Tester groups and build expiry are configurable via repository variables.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/ios-beta-distribution.yml`
- Lane: `ios/EthosProtocol/fastlane/Fastfile` (`beta_distribution`)
- Build notes: `.github/scripts/generate_release_notes.py`
- Setup, secrets, tester groups, and expiry: [docs/ios-beta-distribution.md](docs/ios-beta-distribution.md)

### Android Google Play release automation
The same `vX.Y.Z` tag (matching `versionName` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`) builds the signed release bundle (AAB) and uploads it to Google Play's internal testing track via fastlane. Promotion to production is a staged rollout (10% by default). It's opt-in and gated behind approval on the `play-production` environment, and manual runs can increase, complete, or halt the rollout. Manual runs default to a dry run.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/android-play-store-release.yml`
- Lanes: `android/fastlane/Fastfile` (`validate`, `internal`, `production`, `rollout`)
- Setup, secrets, the first-release manual step, and the maintainer checklist: [docs/android-play-store-release.md](docs/android-play-store-release.md)

### Android Firebase App Distribution (#462)
Every push to `main` builds a debug APK and distributes it to Firebase App Distribution
tester groups automatically. Build notes are generated from conventional commits. Release
APK distribution is also supported for gated beta builds requiring signing. Testers receive
an email notification with a direct download link.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/android-firebase-distribution.yml`
- Lanes: `android/fastlane/Fastfile` (`firebase_beta`, `firebase_distribute`)
- Build notes: `.github/scripts/generate_release_notes.py --platform android`
- Setup, secrets, tester groups, and Firebase Console steps: [docs/android-firebase-beta.md](docs/android-firebase-beta.md)

### App Links Verification (Deep Linking & Passkeys)

Both platforms verify that their respective deep-linking and passkey configuration files are correctly hosted and match the app's entitlements/manifest expectations. These checks run daily and on any change to app configuration, catching server-side drift without requiring a code push:

#### iOS: Apple App Site Association (Universal Links + Passkeys)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ios-applinks-verify.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/verify_apple_app_site_association.sh`
- **Verification targets**:
  - File is reachable at `https://ethos-protocol.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` (HTTP 200)
  - File contains valid JSON
  - `applinks` section lists the app's Team ID + Bundle ID (`com.ethosprotocol`)
  - `webcredentials` section lists the app's Team ID + Bundle ID (required for platform passkeys)
- **Configuration**: Set `APPLE_TEAM_IDENTIFIER` as a repository variable (Apple Developer Team ID, e.g., "ABCDEFGHIJ")

#### Android: Digital Asset Links (App Links + Passkeys)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/android-applinks-verify.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/verify_assetlinks.sh`
- **Verification targets**:
  - File is reachable at `https://ethos-protocol.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json` (HTTP 200)
  - File contains valid JSON
  - Contains `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls` relation for `com.ethosprotocol`
  - Namespace is `android_app`
  - Certificate fingerprint matches the release signing certificate (optional, configurable)
- **Configuration**: Set `ANDROID_CERT_SHA256` as a repository secret (SHA-256 fingerprints, one per line)

Both workflows file an automated GitHub issue alert on scheduled-run failures, avoiding duplicate alerts by commenting on existing open issues instead of creating new ones each run.

### Staging Smoke Test

`.github/workflows/staging-smoke-test.yml` runs `scripts/smoke_test_staging.sh`
against a staging deployment (a separate `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` from the
per-client `API_BASE_URL` set in `Info.plist` / `build.gradle.kts` — staging
is a fixed CI-only target, not something either app build points at). It
exercises auth, `GET /vaults`, and `POST /vaults/{id}/checkin` to catch a
backend/client contract mismatch (see `shared/api-contract.md`) before a
release build is cut. The workflow is exposed via `workflow_call` so a release
workflow can add `needs:` on it once one exists.

### Localization testing
The Android suite includes unit-level localization checks for:
- string length and validation guards (e.g., username and address constraints)
- locale-sensitive number and duration formatting across common locales
- long-string and RTL layout rendering to catch clipping or truncation regressions
- Arabic/Hebrew locale detection for Rtl-aware UI behavior

These checks live in `android/app/src/test/java/com/ethosprotocol/LocalizationTest.kt` and run under the normal `testDebugUnitTest` pipeline, so a locale regression is surfaced in CI with the rest of the Android unit-tests.

### Battery drain testing
Battery-impact checks are tracked via the Android background-task metrics in `android/app/src/main/java/com/ethosprotocol/services/BackgroundTaskScheduler.kt` and the unit suite in `android/app/src/test/java/com/ethosprotocol/BatteryDrainTest.kt`.

The checks cover:
- background task frequency and wake-up budget
- network-bound work that should stay behind a conservative cadence
- power-hungry operations that are explicitly documented and kept under threshold
- scheduled refresh intervals for time-critical vs. idle vault states

These metrics are intended to keep urgent refresh work at a capped wake-up rate while leaving normal idle refreshes at a much lower power profile.

### This workspace already satisfies the requested task list:

Snapshot testing framework: Paparazzi configured
Screens covered: core app screens + widget snapshots
Snapshot update flow: recordPaparazziDebug is documented in the tests
CI comparison: verifyPaparazziDebug is in the Android CI workflow
Documentation: snapshot/test guidance is in the project docs

### Accessibility testing is already in place
This repo already satisfies the requested accessibility-testing work
