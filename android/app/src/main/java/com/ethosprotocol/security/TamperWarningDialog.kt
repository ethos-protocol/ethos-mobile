/**
 * A non-blocking dialog shown when [SignatureVerifier] detects that the APK's
 * signing certificate does not match the expected release certificate.
 *
 * The dialog is *informational only* — it does not prevent the user from
 * continuing to use the app, consistent with the project's approach for
 * integrity warnings (#118: jailbreak/root detection shows a banner, not a
 * hard block). Users who have sideloaded the app intentionally can dismiss
 * the warning and proceed at their own risk.
 *
 * @param onDismiss Called when the user acknowledges the warning (either by
 *                  tapping the confirm button or by tapping outside the dialog).
