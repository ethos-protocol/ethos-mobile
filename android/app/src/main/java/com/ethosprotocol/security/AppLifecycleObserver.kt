 * Process-level lifecycle observer that forwards app-foreground / app-background

 * `MainActivity.onCreate`:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * ProcessLifecycleOwner.get().lifecycle.addObserver(AppLifecycleObserver())

 * when any Activity is started (app foregrounded) and `onStop` fires only when
 * every Activity has stopped (app fully backgrounded), which is the correct
